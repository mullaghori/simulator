                ABOUT MY PROJECT
--------------------------------------------
A web-based sorting algorithm visualizer that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work through animations.

Key Features:
-  Allows users to input their own array.
-  Supports multiple sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
-  Step-by-step visualization of sorting in action.
-  Adjustable speed for better understanding.
-  Clean and responsive UI with Bootstrap.

Tech Stack Used:
-  Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
-  Backend: PHP, MySQL (via XAMPP)
-  Libraries: D3.js / P5.js (for visualization) - for now not included



--------------------------------------------
   DEVIATION FROM THE DD (Design Document)
--------------------------------------------
The Following changes made, which are not depicted in the Design Document:
-  Log Table not included in the DB.
-  Input Table not included in the DB.
-  Algorithm logic is coded in JavaScript, not in PhP
-  FeedBack page is added




--------------------------------------------
    WHAT'S MISSING? (TO BE FIXED SOON)
--------------------------------------------
Planned Fixes & Features:
-  Improved styling for the navigation bar in the header.
-  Refining styles for the array input area.
-  Fonts for smaller screens.
-  Button's behavior on the Algorithm Select Page.
-  Including pages for different algorithm categories (& their descriptions etc).
-  Enhancing visualization styles using JavaScript libraries.
-  Logics to be coded in PhP
-  Create Algorithm, Category and Feedback tables in database and store relevent data




--------------------------------------------
            FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------------------------
Exciting Features Coming Soon:
-  More stylish and visually appealing simulation page (i think their style is not upto the mark).
-  Better visualization & animations for sorting steps (improvements required).
-  Login/Signup System (Optional) - Users can register, but it's not mandatory.
-  Show the usage count of algorithms and update it dynamically
-  Backword sorting
-  Save the feedback form data and help form data in the DB
-  Upload to GitHub & LinkedIn to showcase my work.
-  Maybe host it on a free server for public access.
-  And more updates as new ideas come to my mind!
